# problems at lesions at different points in the given image

 - A : right optic nerve cut
	- monocular vision always : loss of depth perception
	- also always will have a blind spot due to non-coverage of the left eye's optic nerve  not being covered by the right as usual

---

 - B: optic chiasm cut
     	- information not shared between hemispheres : issues in function
	- for instance : an obstacle from left side of left monocular vision will not be passed on to the right hemisphere which controls the functioning of the left motor muscles : potential issues.(consider inversion of "actual" image")
	- right field of left eye and left field of right eye are lost

---

 - C: right optic tract cut
 	- not processing right field of both monocular fields: 
	- again a large drop in portion of field covered

---

 - D: post LGN towards parietal lobe (dorsal stream)
 	- issues with MT: detecting motion may be an issue in the right field of both eyes
	- "How"  will be messed up

---

 - E: post LGN towards temporal lobe (ventral sream)
 	- issues with It: color and object detection may be an issue in the right field of both eyes
	- "What" will be messed up
