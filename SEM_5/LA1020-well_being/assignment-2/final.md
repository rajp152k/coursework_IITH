# Assignment 2 

Answering Question 1

---

Mary's experiences in the episode can be summed up by the following:
 1. Chronic stressor of spousal-abuse and control over her behaviours.
 2. Death of her husband
 3. finding out her husband is alive, courtesy : Dr. Landy

To comment on the final scene of the episode, I address these stressors along the lines of [1] the MetaTheory of Resilience.

One can hypothesize that finding out that her spouse is controlling might have been a disruption in Mary's life. Mary, according to me did not recuperate appropriately from this stressor and can be said to have adapted hedonically[3]. Hedonic adaptation implies accepting a new baseline in response to a (positive or negative) change. This can bucketted into "Reintegration with Loss" as she could have confronted her husband regarding what she really wants and can be seen as her avoiding immediate discomfort at the cost of long-term well-being.

As of now, she has been compromising and somewhat regrets not having expressed this to William. Albeit when she sees 'William' helpless, she expresses his baby-like physical state and convinces Dr. Landy to have him restationed to their residence : she seemed have drawn pleasure from his helplessness.

Recalling the "Reintegration with Loss" stated before, she now only wishes to flaunt her independence to William, as a result of the pent-up emotions over the years. This degenerates into "Dysfunctional Reintegration" as she resorts to all the behaviours that her husband denied her from and not actually things she inherently wished for: this can be observed by the nature of things ranging from harmful(smoking and drinking excessively) to minor(watching television). Lastly the act of placing the mirror such that William can see her seeing television and blowing puffs of smoke on him signify spiteful core intentions. This is a blind spot in her judgment with regards to long-term happiness and depicts the lowest tier of Seligman's PERMA [2] theory.

Hence, I categorize her final state as "Reintegrating Dysfunctionally" according to [1].
