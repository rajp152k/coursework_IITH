## core

 - plot recall 
 Mary, husband dies : not much left ; neuroscientist stores brain. mary uses humor : protective factors at the end : smoking,drinking wine, television, william angry : mary blows a puff of smoke towards his eye : mocking his helplessness.

 what was the trauma : 
    - controlling husband : dominating
    - that is why she was more attracted to the helpless "william" : so that she could rebel : flaunting independence

 - leaning towards dysfunctional Reintregation

 - theory : all her married life : she was feeling chronic stress of being controlled over the minor things. Reintegrated with the chronic stress of discipline from her husband <note what way in this case>. Rebound when the stress was over <listen to that last scene again> 

- Theorize : 
    - 2 disruptions :
    
1. implicit chronic disruption against her innate nature to enjoy : which she probably would have done in moderation.
        -  reintegration with loss to this : staying in comfort zone, not confronting her husband : not resilient : will mention later : accepting a compromise : 
        Hedonic Adaptation : a new baseline for her : Diener, Lucas, & Scollon, 2006
        - https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/hedonic-adaptation

2. explicit "death" of her husband : still slightly normally disrupted until she sees her husbands brain and his helpless state : then she realizes that chronic controlling stressor is no more and nothing is stopping her from actually doing what she wants to : that's a change and homeostasis (majorly spiritual in this case) is in order.

 - I would categorize her behaviour at the end of the episode as dysfunctional integration due to the following reasons:
    - all those things which her husband told her not to do and the act of blowing puffs of smoke into his eyes. She only wanted to flaunt her now helpless husband by doing what she was not said to initially.
 - smoking is definitely bad; drinking and watching television are best done in moderation, lack-thereof which portray hedonism. 
    - This is not sustainable in the long term: according to Seligman's PERMA theory : lowest tier : signifying a blind spot in her judgment
