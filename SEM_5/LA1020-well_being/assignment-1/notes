emodiversity evaluation from inside out

 - start out with a one liner intro to what the report aims to do and also give a brief insight into the concept of emodiversity

# the plot 
 - experiences --> memories (colored orbs) 
    - stored in long term memory : 5 core memory types

 - joy acts as leader: hedonistic approach : avoiding sad memories : never give control to sadness

 - when mom thanks her for coping with the changes, joy takes over and says "yeah, sure", whereas the natural inclination is to remember the past memories : 
 - they make her live in the past and that robs her of being able to express what she really feels in the present

 - joy and sadness end up in the long-term and and joy gets lost in the depths of some sort of loss:

 - during all this riley runs away and the realization of returning only comes when sadness takes control of the headquarters and joy is forgotten in the memory dump

 - this is where joy feels sadness and that realizes that sadness is essential for emotional growth and complexity

 - joyful at any cost : a part of her childhood(bing-bong) stealing orbs of memories, refusing to grow up. 
 but in the end, when time comes to get out of the memory dump, bing-bong lets go and sacrifices, realizing that growing up is more important than living in the past

 - after joy's realization that sadness is necessary to communicate one's internal state, when riley regroups with her parents and conveys what she really feels, a complex orb of both sadness and joy is produced : metaphorically implying the idea, although simplified, of emodiversity
