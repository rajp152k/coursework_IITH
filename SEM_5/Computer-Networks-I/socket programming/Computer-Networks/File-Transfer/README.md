Download server.py and client.py file.
</br>
Run server.py in the terminal.
</br>
Now, make a file client.txt that you want to transfer from client to server.
</br>
Then run client.py.
</br>
After successful transfer, you will find server.txt file which is same as client.txt but generated by server.
</br>
Note: I have added sleep(0.5) after each 1024 Byte transfer for better understanding. Remove this sleep if files are large.
