Chapter 2

The second chapter focuses on the abstract concepts and philosophies linux is based on.

The first segment of the chapter focus on the history of linux where it gives us an idea of how ubiquitous linux is - in web servers, phones, embedded systems and how it all began.
 
In the next segment, the basic ideology of linux is discussed: everything (processes, devices and files) can be represented as files which it borrows heavily from the UNIX OS ( designed for more powerful computers than a PC). All files are stored in a heirarchical manner with root being the top node of the system. It then introduces what are daemons:- processes managing other processes in background in the crudest sense.

We are then introduced how linux is developed and the cause of its rapid development:- ( a major kernel release occurs every 2 or 3 months)
	- it's updated in patches- pushed in by developers which can be 
		- changes 
		- additions
		- subtractions 
	- .. to the existing kernel

In the last section of this chapter, basic linux terminology is clarified.
