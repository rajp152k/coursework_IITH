Chapter 7

this chapter focuses on the basic functionality accessible via the CLI

Initially a basic intro to the terminal is given and actions like shutting down the computer and rebooting are discussed.

Later, they mention pathnames
	- relative ( . , ..  for instance )
		- relative pathnames are relative from the present working directory : displayable quickly using the pwd command.
	- absolute (begins with the root dirtectory and follows the tree)
	- then basic navigation commands through the file system are discussed:
		- cd : change directory with attributes like . , .. , - and pathnames directly..
		- ls : to list the current working directories contents
		- tree for an overview of the files and with -d to just see the output for directories
		- mkdir : to create directories
		- rmdir and rm -r : to remove directories
		- rm on its own to delete files
		- attributes of rm such as i,f,r 
	- then we move on to searching within the file system using the wild card characters *,? and some more with the following commands:
		- locate: search in the database to find all file names matching a pattern
		- find: locate files recursively from a given set of directories
			- its exec attribute to perform some  actions on the found files
	- touch's functionality is then discussed, including but not limited to:
		- creating placeholder files quickly
		- timestamping files as you desire along with accessing, changing or editing times of the file
	- then we talk about upgrading the packages using a package management tool such as apt on ubuntu:
	- what i do personally is the following 3 commands in succession:
		- sudo apt-get update		: updates dependencies 
		- sudo apt-get upgrade		: downloads and installs the new dependencies	
		- sudo apt-get autoremove  	: cleans up the old packages which are not required anymore
