output explanation
the time taken is as expected : a little over 20 seconds
the first 3 prints just as they are scheduled by the processor and are not under our control (their chronology)
the next 18 prints are from child 1 (operates for 9 seconds after initial 1 second sleep)
the next 2  prints are from child 2 the latter one being for killing child 1 
then parent prints its message for getting a status update on child1
then child 2 gets killed after printing its last message after which parent prints its last message and exits
