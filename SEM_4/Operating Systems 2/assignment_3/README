3 directories, 8 files

Compilation instructions:
	1. run make in the parent directory and the object files and modules will be produced in the corresponding sub-directories
	
General running instructions:(from parent directory)
Consider cleaning up the dmesg log before proceeding to allow for a more precise look on how module functionalities are being used as follows:-
-# dmesg -C
	1. load the module using insmod and get the major number using grep as follows:-
		-# insmod kernel/mykmod.ko
		-# cat /proc/devices | grep mykmod
	2. create a device special file using the major number found, as follows:-
		-# mknod <path to the device special file including the name> c <major no> <minor no>
	3. perform operations on the device using the ./util/memutil executable as follows:-
		-# ./util/memutil <path to the device special file> <arguments>
			- call -h in arguments of the memutil executable to get the argument formats:-
	4. unload the driver and delete the device files once you are done with the utilities:-
		-# rm -r <path to the device file>
		-# rmmod mykmod
	5. the output log is now present in dmesg; to further filter it down to only what concerns the module, run :-
		-# dmesg | grep mykmod > dmesg_output	
			- the concerned output log will be printed out in dmesg_output
